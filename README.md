##Geological Coordinates and Mapping

While studying earthquake engineering, I needed to use coordinates for the calculations. Also, illustrating geological coordinates and mapping are useful tools to present analysis. Therefore, this repository is created to remind me of what I learned, and to share. This repository includes reminder notes and codes. These contents could be about theoretical lecture notes of earthquake engineering and applications.
